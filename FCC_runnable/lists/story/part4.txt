Later HE became a PROFESSION. It was a dream come true for HIM.
When HE grew older, HE unwillingly participated in EVENT2.
During BATTLE HIS WEAPON broke, leaving HIM helpless on the battlefield. By some miracle HE managed to survive.
HE fought ADJECTIVE at BATTLE. HE hoped to get a song written about HIM.
HE got drunk before BATTLE and forgot where HE had put HIS WEAPON.
At one point HE decided to become PROFESSION. But HIS lack of skill soon turned HIM around.
HE became a PROFESSION, but was lousy at it and decided to do something else.
HE spent most of HIS adult days drunk in TAVERN.
During BATTLE HE got overwhelmed by the ENEMY horde but DEITY, intervened.
At the age of AGE, HE got drunk and fell from the cliff. HE died soon after.
During BATTLE HE tripped on HIS own WEAPON. HE died instantly. Mocking songs are still being sung in TAVERN.
When HE got older HE finally realised how much HE loved LIKES.
HE opened HIS own tavern which HE, for some unknown reason, named TAVERN.
On a WEATHER SEASON morning just before BATTLE, HE was wondering why HE didn't become PROFESSION.
